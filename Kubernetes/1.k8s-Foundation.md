**Kubernetes (K8s)** is an open-source container orchestration platform used to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  
It was originally developed by **Google** and is now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.

---


## 🚀 Key Features

- **Automated Scheduling:** Places containers on optimal nodes.  
- **Self-Healing:** Restarts or replaces failed containers automatically.  
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scales apps up or down based on load.  
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** Exposes containers as services and balances traffic.  
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts local or cloud storage.  
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks:** Deploy updates with zero downtime and revert if needed.  
- **Secret & Config Management:** Manages sensitive data securely.  
- **Health Monitoring:** Monitors containers and nodes for cluster stability.  

---

### 💡 Example Use Case

Imagine a web app running in 10 containers across multiple servers. Kubernetes will:

- Distribute containers evenly across available servers.  
- Auto-replace crashed containers.  
- Route traffic only to available containers — avoiding downtime.

---

## ⚙️ Why We Need an Orchestration Tool

Manually managing a few containers is simple — but at scale, it becomes difficult:

| Problem | Manual Management Issue |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Scaling** | Tedious to start/stop containers manually |
| **Load Balancing** | Hard to distribute user traffic manually |
| **High Availability** | Slow to detect and restart failed containers |
| **Networking** | Complex multi-host networking setup |
| **Zero-Downtime Updates** | Difficult to update without affecting users |

**Example:**  
If 100 containers run on 5 servers and one server fails, you must manually restart containers and update load balancers. Kubernetes automates all of this.

---

## 🌍 Why Kubernetes?

- **Open Source:** Free and vendor-neutral  
- **Extensible:** Integrates with plugins/APIs  
- **Scalable & Portable:** Runs on any environment  
- **Self-Healing & Resilient:** Recovers from failures automatically  
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Supported by community and all major cloud providers

## 🏗️ Architecture of Kubernetes

![Kubernetes Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2e45541-9b3a-4e53-bf7b-cf2fab098f35)

### Master–Worker Pattern

- **Control Plane (Master):** Manages cluster state and decisions.  
- **Worker Nodes:** Run actual application workloads (Pods).

---

### 🧩 Control Plane Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **API Server (`kube-apiserver`)** | Entry point for all cluster operations |
| **etcd** | Key-value store holding cluster state/configuration |
| **Controller Manager** | Ensures desired state (e.g., correct pod count) |
| **Scheduler** | Assigns new pods to suitable nodes |
| **Cloud Controller Manager** | Integrates Kubernetes with cloud provider APIs |

---

### ⚙️ Worker Node Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Kubelet** | Ensures containers in pods are running and healthy |
| **Kube-Proxy** | Manages network traffic routing to pods |
| **Container Runtime** | Executes containers (e.g., Docker, containerd) |

---

## 📦 Key Kubernetes Objects & Resources

| Object | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit (1+ containers) |
| **Service** | Stable endpoint for accessing pods |
| **Deployment** | Manages rollouts & updates |
| **ReplicaSet** | Ensures required pod replicas |
| **StatefulSet / DaemonSet / Job / CronJob** | Specialized workloads |
| **ConfigMap / Secret** | Stores configuration & sensitive data |
| **Namespace** | Logical separation for organization |
| **Ingress** | Manages external HTTP(S) routing |
| **NetworkPolicy** | Controls pod network communication |

---

## 🧱 Kubernetes Architecture Summary

- **Control Plane (Master Node):** Manages cluster state  
- **Worker Node:** Runs app containers in Pods  
- **Pods:** The running units of applications  
- **Additional Components:** ConfigMaps, Secrets, Namespaces, Ingress, etc.

---

## 🔁 Example Workflow

1. User defines desired state → `kubectl apply -f app.yaml`  
2. **API Server** stores the intent in **etcd**  
3. **Scheduler** assigns pods to worker nodes  
4. **Kubelet** starts containers as per spec  
5. **Controller Manager** ensures desired number of pods  
6. **Kube-Proxy** routes network traffic properly  

---

## ⚡ Pod Lifecycle Phases

| Phase | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| **Pending** | Waiting to be scheduled |
| **Running** | Containers active |
| **Succeeded** | All containers exited successfully |
| **Failed** | One or more containers failed |
| **Unknown** | Node/network issue prevents status |

---

## 🧰 Cluster Creation Methods

| Tool/Service | Description | Use Case |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Minikube** | Local cluster in VM/Docker | Learning, local dev |
| **Kind** | Cluster in Docker containers | CI/CD, testing |
| **kubeadm** | Manual cluster bootstrap | Custom prod setups |
| **EKS** | AWS-managed Kubernetes | AWS production |
| **GKE** | Google-managed Kubernetes | GCP production |
| **AKS** | Azure-managed Kubernetes | Azure production |

---

## 🧩 Introduction to Pods and Services

### Pods

- The **smallest deployable object** in Kubernetes.  
- Runs one or more containers sharing network & storage.

**Lifecycle:** Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → Terminated  

**Use Cases:**  
- Single-container apps (web, backend, etc.)  
- Multi-container setups (proxy + app sidecar)

---

### Services

Provides stable networking for Pods.

| Type | Accessible From | Use Case | Access Format |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **ClusterIP** | Inside cluster | Internal traffic | `http://backend:8080` |
| **NodePort** | Node IP + port | Test/demo external | `http://<node-ip>:30080` |
| **LoadBalancer** | Internet | Public access | `http://<public-ip>` |

---

### Main vs Sidecar Container

| Container Type | Role | Example |
|----------------|------|----------|
| **Main Container** | Runs core app | Backend API |
| **Sidecar Container** | Handles helper tasks | Log collector, proxy |

## 🧑‍💻 Run Your First Pod

```bash
# Create a basic nginx pod
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never

# View pods
kubectl get pods

# View details
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod

```
🌐 Expose Pod as a Service
```bash

# Expose pod as NodePort
kubectl expose pod nginx-pod --type=NodePort --port=80

# View services
kubectl get svc

# Access via
http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
🧭 Common kubectl Commands

#to see resource
