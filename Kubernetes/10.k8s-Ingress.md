# Ingress in Kubernetes 

##  What is Ingress?
Ingress is a **Kubernetes API object** that manages **external access** to applications running inside the cluster.  
It provides **HTTP/HTTPS routing** to internal Services.

Ingress = Intelligent router → Maps incoming requests to backend services using rules like:
- URL paths (e.g., `/app1`)
- Hostnames (e.g., `app.example.com`)

---

##  Why Do We Need Ingress?
Without Ingress, every service that needs external access must use:
- **NodePort** (port exposed on every node)  
- **LoadBalancer** (AWS/Azure/GCP external LB for each service)

This becomes expensive and unmanageable.

**Ingress solves this by using one single Load Balancer** → then routes traffic internally.

---

##  Components of Ingress
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ingress Resource** | The YAML object containing routing rules. |
| **Ingress Controller** | Software that implements Ingress logic (e.g., NGINX). |
| **Service** | Backend target that receives traffic. |
| **Pods/Deployments** | Applications that run behind the services. |

Ingress works ONLY when an **Ingress Controller** is installed.

Most popular: **NGINX Ingress Controller**.

##  How Ingress Works (High-Level Flow)

Client → DNS (LB hostname) → Cloud Load Balancer → Ingress Controller → Service → Pod

1. User hits LB DNS (created by controller).  
2. LB forwards traffic to Ingress Controller Pod.  
3. Controller checks rules in `Ingress` YAML.  
4. Routes to appropriate **Service**.  
5. Service forwards traffic to **Pods**.

##  Features of Ingress

###  HTTP/HTTPS Routing
Route based on:
- **Path** (e.g., `/app1 → app1-svc`)
- **Host** (e.g., `app.example.com → app1-svc`)

###  TLS/SSL Termination
You can attach certificates so HTTPS terminates at Ingress.

###  Load Balancing
Internal traffic is balanced across backend Pods.

###  URL Rewriting
Rewrite paths using annotations.

###  Centralized access point
One LB for all services → cheaper & simpler.

---

##  Types of Ingress Routing

### 🔹 **1. Path-Based Routing**
Different URL paths → different Services.

Example:
/app1 → app1-svc
/app2 → app2-svc

### 🔹 **2. Host-Based Routing**
Different domains → different Services.

Example:
app1.example.com → app1-svc
app2.example.com → app2-svc

##  Common Annotations in NGINX Ingress

| Annotation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` | Rewrite incoming URL. |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect` | Force HTTPS. |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size` | Increase request body size. |

To view annotations applied:
kubectl describe ing <ingress-name>

##  Ingress Controller (Important!)
Ingress WILL NOT WORK without an Ingress Controller.

Most common:
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**
- AWS ALB Ingress Controller
- Traefik
- Istio Gateway

In EKS:  
We use **NGINX Ingress Controller** → creates an AWS Load Balancer automatically.

Install:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

## Ingress YAML Structure (Concept)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
# Practical for Ingress
## Step 1. Setup the EKS Cluster With EC2 instance
   **For setup you can refer this notes***
   ```bash
