#  Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) 

## What are Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)?

Kubernetes Pods are ephemeral(lasting or used for only a short period of time) ! By default, if a Pod dies or is replaced, any data it stores is **lost**. **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** are Kubernetes abstractions that let you store data *outside* the Pod, so it survives restarts, rescheduling, and even cluster upgrades.

##  Persistent Volume (PV)

A **Persistent Volume (PV)** is a piece of storage in your cluster:
- Provisioned by an admin (static) or by Kubernetes using a StorageClass (dynamic).
- Backed by physical devices (local disk, NFS, AWS EBS, etc).
- Independent of Pods or namespaces.

### Key Points
- Cluster-scoped resource (NOT namespaced)
- Supports access modes: ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany
- Retains data according to reclaim policy (Retain, Delete, Recycle)

##  Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

A **PVC** is a user's request for storage:
- Specifies storage size, access mode, and (optionally) a StorageClass.
- When a compatible PV is found (or dynamically provisioned), Kubernetes binds the PVC to the PV.
- Pod mounts the PVC as a regular volume.

### Key Points
- Namespaced resource (belongs to a single namespace)
- Enables multi-tenant, self-service storage
