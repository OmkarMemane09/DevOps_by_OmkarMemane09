#  Kubernetes Manifest Files

A **Kubernetes manifest file** is a configuration file (usually written in YAML) that describes the desired state of resources inside a Kubernetes cluster.  
These files are **declarative** — you define *what you want* (apps, replicas, ports, etc.), and **Kubernetes makes it happen**.

## Types of Kubernetes Manifest Files

Each manifest file corresponds to a specific **Kubernetes object**.  
Below are the most common types with examples and use cases �

## 📄 Pod vs. Deployment vs. Service vs. ConfigMap vs. Secret

| Manifest Type | What It Does                                            | File Example                 | Key Points                                                                 |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Pod**       | Defines a single Pod (one or more containers).         | `nginx-pod.yaml`             | - Smallest unit that runs containers<br>- Not auto-restarted/scaled by itself<br>- Use for test runs or simple one-off tasks |
| **Deployment**| Defines a scalable, managed set of Pods.               | `nginx-deployment.yaml`      | - Best for stateless apps<br>- Supports scaling, rolling updates, rollback<br>- Ensures specified number of pods always running |
| **Service**   | Provides stable networking to expose Pods/apps.         | `nginx-service.yaml`         | - Exposes Pods via a single IP/DNS<br>- Supports internal and external traffic<br>- Load balances among matched Pods |
| **ConfigMap** | Provides configuration data to Pods/containers.         | `app-configmap.yaml`         | - Stores non-sensitive environment/config data<br>- Easy to update without changing Pod definitions<br>- Decouples app code from configs |
| **Secret**    | Stores sensitive information (passwords, keys, etc.).   | `app-secret.yaml`            | - Stores base64-encoded sensitive data<br>- Passes secrets to Pods as env variables or volumes<br>- More secure than ConfigMap for secrets |

###  1. Pod Manifest

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Use: For testing or running a standalone container.

###  2. Deployment Manifest
A Deployment manages multiple identical Pods and supports scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
```
Use: For managing stateless apps and ensuring smooth updates.

###  3. Service Manifest
A Service provides a stable network endpoint to access Pods and ensures load balancing.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
Use: For connecting Pods, load balancing, and exposing workloads.
```

### 4. ConfigMap Manifest
A ConfigMap holds non-sensitive configuration data for your containers.
```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  SETTING: "value"
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
```
Use: For storing environment variables or non-secret configuration.


###  5. Secret Manifest
A Secret stores sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or keys in a secure way.
```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # base64 for "password"
```
Use: For encrypted and sensitive information in containers.


### 6. Other Common Manifest Types
Type	Description
*ReplicaSet	Ensures a specific number of Pod replicas are running.
StatefulSet	For apps requiring persistent identity and storage.
Ingress	Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access and routing to Services.*

## Structure of a Manifest File

Every manifest follows this general structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: <API version>
kind: <Resource type>
metadata:
  name: <Resource name>
spec:
  ... <object specifications>
```
###  Structure Fields in a Kubernetes Manifest

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `apiVersion` | Kubernetes API version for the object. |
| `kind` | Type of resource (e.g., Pod, Deployment, Service). |
| `metadata` | Identifies the resource with name and labels. |
| `spec` | Defines the desired behavior or configuration. |

##  Summary Table

| **Manifest Type** | **Defines** | **Typical Use Case** |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Pod** | Single Pod/Containers | Running a single workload or test |
| **Deployment** | ReplicaSet of Pods | Scalable stateless applications |
| **Service** | Stable network endpoint | Exposing or connecting workloads |
| **ConfigMap** | Configuration data | Non-secret environment variables |
| **Secret** | Sensitive data | Storing passwords, tokens |
| **Ingress** | HTTP/S Gateway/routing | Managing external access |

### Why Use Manifests?
Kubernetes manifests are the foundation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
They ensure your applications, configurations, and infrastructure are:

Reliable

Scalable

Version-controlled
