#  Kubernetes Manifest Files

A **Kubernetes manifest file** is a configuration file (usually written in YAML) that describes the desired state of resources inside a Kubernetes cluster.  
These files are **declarative** — you define *what you want* (apps, replicas, ports, etc.), and **Kubernetes makes it happen**.  

---

## Types of Kubernetes Manifest Files

Each manifest file corresponds to a specific **Kubernetes object**.  
Below are the most common types with examples and use cases �

---

###  1. Pod Manifest

A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Use: For testing or running a standalone container.

###  2. Deployment Manifest
A Deployment manages multiple identical Pods and supports scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
```
Use: For managing stateless apps and ensuring smooth updates.

###  3. Service Manifest
A Service provides a stable network endpoint to access Pods and ensures load balancing.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
Use: For connecting Pods, load balancing, and exposing workloads.
```

### 4. ConfigMap Manifest
A ConfigMap holds non-sensitive configuration data for your containers.
```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  SETTING: "value"
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
```
Use: For storing environment variables or non-secret configuration.


###  5. Secret Manifest
A Secret stores sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or keys in a secure way.
```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # base64 for "password"
```
Use: For encrypted and sensitive information in containers.


### 6. Other Common Manifest Types
Type	Description
*ReplicaSet	Ensures a specific number of Pod replicas are running.
StatefulSet	For apps requiring persistent identity and storage.
Ingress	Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access and routing to Services.*

## Structure of a Manifest File

Every manifest follows this general structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: <API version>
kind: <Resource type>
metadata:
  name: <Resource name>
spec:
  ... <object specifications>
```
###  Structure Fields in a Kubernetes Manifest

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `apiVersion` | Kubernetes API version for the object. |
| `kind` | Type of resource (e.g., Pod, Deployment, Service). |
| `metadata` | Identifies the resource with name and labels. |
| `spec` | Defines the desired behavior or configuration. |

---

##  Summary Table

| **Manifest Type** | **Defines** | **Typical Use Case** |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Pod** | Single Pod/Containers | Running a single workload or test |
| **Deployment** | ReplicaSet of Pods | Scalable stateless applications |
| **Service** | Stable network endpoint | Exposing or connecting workloads |
| **ConfigMap** | Configuration data | Non-secret environment variables |
| **Secret** | Sensitive data | Storing passwords, tokens |
| **Ingress** | HTTP/S Gateway/routing | Managing external access |

### Why Use Manifests?
Kubernetes manifests are the foundation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
They ensure your applications, configurations, and infrastructure are:

Reliable

Scalable

Version-controlled
