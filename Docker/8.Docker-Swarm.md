# 🐳 What is Docker Swarm?

**Docker Swarm is Docker’s native container orchestration tool.**
*It allows you to create, manage, and scale a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system called a Swarm.*

###### With Swarm, you can:

 - Deploy services across multiple machines

 - Auto-distribute containers

 - Scale horizontally

 - Load-balance traffic

 - Perform rolling updates

**Swarm is built directly into Docker Engine — no separate installation needed.**

### Features
- Cluster Management =	Manage nodes as one virtual Docker host

- Service Scaling	= Scale services up/down anytime

- Load Balancing =	Distributes traffic across replicas

- Self-Healing =	Automatically replaces failed tasks

- Rolling Updates	= Zero-downtime deployments

*Secure by Default	TLS-based encrypted communication*

🎯 Why Docker Swarm?

Extremely easy to setup

Uses same Docker commands you already know

Ideal for learning container orchestration

Lightweight alternative to Kubernetes

Perfect for:

DevOps beginners

Local clusters

Production-lite environments

Microservice projects

🔧 Core Components
1. Node

A machine part of the swarm (Manager or Worker).

2. Manager Node

Schedules tasks

Runs RAFT consensus

Manages state of cluster

3. Worker Node

Executes container tasks

Reports health/status to managers

4. Service

A definition of a group of containers (tasks).

5. Task

A single running container instance.

6. Stack

A multi-service application defined using Compose.

🛠️ Prerequisites

1 Manager node

1–2 Worker nodes

Docker installed on all machines

Ubuntu / EC2 / VirtualBox / WSL supported

🚀 Hands-On: Build a Swarm Cluster
1️⃣ Install Docker on All Nodes
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

2️⃣ Initialize Swarm (Manager)
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>


Example:

docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.10


Swarm outputs a worker join command:

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xyz <MANAGER-IP>:2377

3️⃣ Join Worker Nodes

Run on every worker node:

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xyz 192.168.1.10:2377

4️⃣ Verify Nodes
docker node ls

🧩 Swarm Services & Operations
✔️ Create a Service
docker service create --name webapp -p 8080:80 nginx

✔️ List Services
docker service ls

✔️ Check Service Tasks
docker service ps webapp

✔️ Inspect Service
docker service inspect --pretty webapp

📈 Scaling & Load Balancing
Scale service replicas:
docker service scale webapp=5


Load-balancing automatically distributes traffic across all replicas.

🔄 Rolling Updates & Rollback
Update to new image:
docker service update --image nginx:latest webapp

Rollback if failed:
docker service rollback webapp

📦 Deploy Using Docker Stack

Create docker-compose.yml:

version: "3"
services:
  frontend:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  backend:
    image: httpd
    ports:
      - "9000:80"


Deploy:

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack


List stack:

docker stack ls


Services in stack:

docker stack services mystack


Remove stack:

docker stack rm mystack

👥 Node Management
List nodes:
docker node ls

Drain a node (maintenance):
docker node update --availability drain worker1

Activate node:
docker node update --availability active worker1

Remove a node:
docker node rm worker1

🧰 Service Management
Remove a service:
docker service rm webapp

Update replicas:
docker service update --replicas=10 webapp

Update environment variables:
docker service update --env-add KEY=value webapp

🌐 Swarm Networking
Create an overlay network:
docker network create -d overlay myoverlay

Use in a service:
docker service create --name api --network myoverlay nginx
