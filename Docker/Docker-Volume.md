## 📘 Introduction
Docker Volumes are used to **persist data** generated by and used by Docker containers.  
Even if a container is removed, the data inside a Docker volume remains intact.

## 🧩 Why Use Volumes?
- Containers are **ephemeral** — data inside them is lost when they are deleted.  
- Volumes help **store data permanently** outside the container’s writable layer.  
- Volumes can be **shared between containers**.  
- They improve **performance** and make **backups easier**.

## ⚙️ Types of Docker Storage
| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Volume** | Managed by Docker and stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`. Recommended for persistent data. |
| **Bind Mount** | Maps a host machine directory or file to a container path. |
| **tmpfs Mount** | Data stored in memory only (non-persistent). |

---

## 🏗️ Basic Volume Commands

```bash
# Create a new volume
docker volume create myvolume

# List all volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a volume (shows path and config)
docker volume inspect myvolume

# Remove a volume
docker volume rm myvolume
```
## 📦 Using Volumes with Containers

```bash
# Attach a volume to a container
docker run -it --name mycontainer -v myvolume:/data ubuntu

# Anything written inside /data in the container
# will be stored in the volume (persistent)

*Example*

# Inside the container
cd /data
echo "Hello Volume" > file.txt
exit

Now even if you remove the container:

docker rm -f mycontainer
The data will still exist in:
/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data/file.txt

```
## 🧠 Practical 
🎯 Objective:
Create a Docker network, attach a container to it, create files inside a path (like /mnt),
and verify that the data persists in Docker volumes even after container deletion.

### 🔧 Steps:
```bash

Create a custom Docker network
docker network create mynetwork

Run a container connected to the network with a volume 
docker run -it --name mycontainer --network mynetwork -v myvolume:/mnt ubuntu

Go inside the container
docker exec -it mycontainer bash

Navigate to /mnt and create some files
cd /mnt
touch file1.txt file2.txt
echo "This is stored in Docker Volume" > file1.txt
exit

Check where the volume data is stored on host
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data
ls

# Output: file1.txt file2.txt

Delete the container
docker rm -f mycontainer

Verify data persistence
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data
ls
# Files still exist even after container deletion

✅ Result: The files created inside the container remain stored inside the Docker volume.
```
